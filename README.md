# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
Using Gmaps and API's, I generated a set of random latitude and longitudes, and gathered information from these cities, including the current weather description, the max temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed. I then exported this dataframe to a CSV. In deliverable #2, I imported the CSV and created a new dataframe based on the min and max temperature preferences the user inputs for their travel destination. I then created a new dataframe of hotels that fall within the user's temperature preferences. I exported this dataframe to a csv, and generated an interactive map with pop up markers for each hotel that included the hotel name, the city, the country, and the currenty weather description. In deliverable 3, utilizing our second csv file, I chose 4 cities close together and created a travel itinerary, with a map of the beginning location, the 3 waypoints, and the end location. I then refactored this code to create a new map with pop up markers for each of the four cities/hotels.
